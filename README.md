# Crash-Course-on-Python
I've taken the **Google IT Automation with Python Specialization** and this is the first course I've completed under this specialization.

- Finally at the last I've created a **Word Cloud** using my texts which were stored in a .txt file.

**The WORD CLOUD Image** which is generated using Python:
